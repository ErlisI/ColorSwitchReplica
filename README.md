# ColorSwitchReplica

Using Unity Engine to create a replica of the famous game "Color Switch Replica Game"

## Rules of the game:
  - Go through the circle with the same color as the ball
  - If you hit the circle on another color you lose
  - If you "collect" the other ball you change the color
  - If you pass the white line you win the level

P.S: Losing quite a bit of frames there for making the video into a gif!
